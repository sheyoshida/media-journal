# Unit 2 Final Project

## The Journal (or, more generally, logging)

**Project Due:** 10/19  
**Practice Demos:** 10/20  
**Final Demos:** 10/22

## Feature Requirements

**Basic Application**  
A user must be able to log information about a situation. In the context of a traditional journal this would mean using text to feelings/experiences. Or a photo journal, where one would log moments based solely on photos. You get the picture.

**APIs**  
You should be thoughtful picking your APIs. Don't select them at random. Instead, find APIs that support the theme of your application and can be used to enhance the experience.
 
**Persistence**  
Your application must incorporate some sort of data persistence. In this unit we've covered three different options: `NSUserDefaults`, `Core Data`, and *remote storage*. There are no requirements as to which option you choose. You should make the best decision based on the nature of your application.

## Technical Requirements
* Your application must allow users to create a "post" or an "entry" into this journal.
* Your application must incorcoporate *n* APIs (n = number of people in your group)

## Project Plan

* A PROJECT PLAN IS REQUIRED
* You must use Trello, or something very similar. 
* Your project plan should fall into the following categories:
  * Individual tasks
  * Tasks that are *in-progress*
  * For review / merge
