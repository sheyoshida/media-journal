# The Goal: 

This is version 1.0 of my C4Q Unit 2 homework project. We were given two weeks to [create a journal that would log entries, incorporate APIs and allow data to persist](https://github.com/accesscode-2-2/unit-2-final-project). Since everyone loves lists, my team's goal was to create a media tracker that would allow users to record and reflect upon all of the books, movies and albums that they experience throughout the year.

# The App: 

Throughout the process, I was mindful of adopting an MVP strategy which ensured that the first round of features were practical. I also made an effort to ensure that our UI experience was unique and incorporated collection view cells, a fun [folding tab bar controller](https://github.com/Yalantis/FoldingTabBar.iOS) and custom animation with 
[Facebook's POP](https://github.com/facebook/pop) files. To keep our data from vanishing I learned how easy it is to 
use [Parse](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX). Later, my team incorporated the [Facebook SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) which adds a social element; our users can share their new discoveries.

# Project Planning: 
I get really excited about project/product planning and used Keynote to create mockups that kept our team focused on a common goal.

# Next Steps: 

Eventually, I would love to add sorting features so that users can determine exactly which books, films and albums were their favorites at the end of the year. Since we already have Facebook sharing enabled, I would like to refine and expand that functionality.
