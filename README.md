# media-journal

This is version 1.0 of my C4Q Unit 2 homework project. We were asked to [create a journal that would log entries, 
incorporate APIs and allow data to persist](https://github.com/accesscode-2-2/unit-2-final-project). Since everyone loves lists, 
my team's goal was to create a media tracker that would allow users to record and reflect upon all of the books, 
movies and albums that they experience throughout the year. 

Throughout the process, I was mindful of adopting an MVP strategy which ensured that the first round of features were 
practical. We did make an effort to ensure that our UI experience was unique and incorporated collection view cells 
and a fun [folding tab bar controller](https://github.com/Yalantis/FoldingTabBar.iOS) and custom animation with 
[Facebook's POP](https://github.com/facebook/pop) files. To keep our data from vanishing I learned how easy it is to 
use [Parse](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX). Later, we incorporated the [Facebook SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) 
which adds a social element; users can share their new discoveries.
